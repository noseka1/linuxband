Table of chords. All are based on a C scale.
Generating chords is easy in MIDI since we just need to
add/subtract constants, based on yet another table.

CAUTION, if you add to this table make sure there are at least
3 notes in each chord! Don't make any chord longer than 8 notes
(The pattern define sets volumes for only 8).

There is a corresponding scale set for each chord. These are
used by bass and scale patterns.

Each chord needs an English doc string. This is extracted by the
-Dn option to print a table of chordnames for inclusion in the
reference manual.
